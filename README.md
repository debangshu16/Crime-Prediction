# Crime-Prediction
# Abstract
Every time we see the news of violent crimes in our television sets, we feel more and more concerned and disheartened. The question ultimately arises whether this could have been somehow predicted beforehand and hence prevented. With this very question in mind, this project aims to study the Communities and Crime dataset [3] available publicly in the UCI Machine Learning Repository to try to find some insightful details and some possible explanatory variables that can predict such atrocities. The ultimate aim of the model created is to predict the number of violent crimes(murder, rape, robbery, and assault) per 100K population of a given community. The paper revolves around finding a set of important features (actual or engineered) and building a regression model which satisfies all the model assumptions. Our Ridge regression model with MAE value of 0.0482 on the chosen set of important features not only outperform the MAE metric of 0.096 recorded in [4], but also, we can draw a confidence interval around our predictions to reduce uncertainty.
